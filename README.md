# GenerationScheduling-
Matlab software for electric generation scheduling using the iterative method.

The software was written to fulfill the requirements of bachelor of science at Princess Sumaya University for Technology, the title of bachelor thesis: "Algorithm Design for Generation Scheduling using Genetic Algorithms and Gradient Iterative method", 2016.

The offered code gives the following options:
1. Scheduling without taking into account the generation limits.
2. scheduling taking into account the generation limits of each generator.
3. scheduling taking into account generation limits as well as transmission losses in the network.
